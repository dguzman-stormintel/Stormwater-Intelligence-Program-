## Overview
**Stormwater Intelligence** is an AI-driven environmental platform that merges compliance, geospatial analytics, and intelligent automation.  
It transforms stormwater and remediation workflows into **data-driven, self-optimizing systems**.

This initiative bridges **field operations, regulatory compliance, and machine intelligence**, giving professionals a unified view of their sites, weather data, and inspection activity—all governed by the **ARCSEC Protocol** for verified authorship and integrity.

---

## Core Capabilities
- **StormGPT Integration:** AI-powered compliance reporting, inspection generation, and risk forecasting.  
- **3D Geospatial Mapping:** Real-time visualization of watersheds and environmental assets.  
- **Data Automation:** Live NOAA, USGS, EPA, and NASA data ingestion for predictive modeling.  
- **ARCSEC Governance:** Every artifact cryptographically verified under Daniel Guzman’s authorship.  

---

## Mission
To modernize environmental management by embedding **artificial intelligence** directly into stormwater, remediation, and compliance infrastructure.  
The result: faster decisions, verified records, and automated environmental intelligence.
